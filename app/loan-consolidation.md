## Direct Loan Consolidation
Consolidation loans combine one or more federal student loans into one new loan held by a single lender. Since July 1, 2010, the only available lender for federal consolidation loans is then U.S. Department of Education. 
If you are having trouble keeping track of multiple student loan payments, consolidation could help. It can also be useful if you need to extend your repayment, want to qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness, or have run out of forbearance time. 

## How It Works
* You must have at least one eligible federal student loan to consolidate.
* You cannot consolidate private and federal loans together.
* The U.S. Department of Education (ED) does not require a minimum balance to consolidate your loans.
* Your new loan will have new terms.
* Your loan will have a new interest rate, which will be the weighted average of the loans you consolidated rounded up to the nearest 1/8th of a percent (for an example, see below). 
* After you consolidate, your repayment schedule will be reset to standard repayment. You may then choose a different payment schedule.
* Based on your total education loan debt (including private loans), you could extend your repayment to a maximum of 30 years.
* Loan consolidation cannot be reversed.
* Consolidation loans can be re-consolidated to add additional eligible education loans.
* There are no penalties for prepayment or finishing repayment ahead of schedule.

* Graduated:  Payments will begin at a lower amount and will gradually increase every two years.  Loan term is 10 to 30 years.
* Income Contingent:  Monthly payments are based upon your adjusted gross family income, family size, 	  and loan balance.  This payment is subject to change upon annual review of financial situation.  Any amount still outstanding after 25 years is forgiven.
* Income Based:  Monthly payments are based upon your adjusted gross family  income and family size.       	 This payment is subject to change upon annual review of financial situation.  Any amount still outstanding after 25 years is forgiven.
